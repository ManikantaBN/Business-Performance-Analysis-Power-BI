# Visuals
1.) Plot a line and stacked column chart with “Order Item total” and “order Profit per order” with respect to order date. As shown below.

2.) Create a calculated table that filters out all the products with the highest profit ratio, and lists the below-mentioned 3 columns in the calculated table.

3.) Create a DAX calculated column to find the number of units sold for each product’s card id, as shown below. Then find a product with the 4th highest sold products.
